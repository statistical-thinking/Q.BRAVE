# About
Q-BRAVE illustrates the functionality of a Qubit via a graphical representation of a Bloch Sphere and the corresponding quantum states in Python, while the quantum states can be simulated on a Raspberry Pi Zero / Raspberry Pi Zero 2. Jupyter notebooks are provided for both visualization and simulation.
