# Q-BRAVE
(Q)uantum (B)it on (R)aspberry Pi (A)pplications for (V)irtual (E)xploration

# AUTHOR
Prof. Dr. habil. Dennis Klinkhammer

# Requirements
MatPlotLib

# About
Q-BRAVE illustrates the functionality of a Qubit via a graphical representation of a Bloch Sphere and the corresponding quantum states in Python, while the quantum states can be simulated on a Raspberry Pi Zero / Raspberry Pi Zero 2. Jupyter notebooks are provided for both visualization and simulation. The purpose of Q-BRAVE is to provide a simple and cost-effective introduction to how a quantum computer works, exclusively for educational purposes.
